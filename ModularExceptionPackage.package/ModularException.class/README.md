This class provides methods to add exception handling to other methods in an easy, lightweight, modular way.

The exception handlings that can be added are:
1) Parameters for a method being nil.
2) Messages being sent to nil objects.


This can be done in multiple ways:
1) Through meta links
2) Through wrappers
3) Through automatic code change
